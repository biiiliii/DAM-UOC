# DAM-UOC

I am studying development of multi-platform applications at UOC (Open University of Catalonia)

I will be posting any code I make in this repo during the course ðŸ˜Š

> [!NOTE]
> The codes listed up there are not usually how I would structure them, but I am given some rules that I must follow to pass ðŸ˜…

> [!CAUTION]
> DISCLAIMER: I do not encourage in any way to copy or use this code if you are a student coursing the same degree.<br>
> Doing so, would mean that you are not doing what's being asked for the teacher.<br>
> I will not take any responsability of bad use of this repo.
